## Type Ahead Demo using Combine with SwiftUI
This project is so I can experiment with the new SwiftUI & Combine API's.

## Setup
This project uses the Seatgeek API to accomplish type ahead to demonstrate observable programming with combine.

Go to http://platform.seatgeek.com/ and register for a dev account. Once you have the `client_id` copy the `Secrets.example.xcconfig` to `Secrets.xcconfig` and replace the value in file.

## Todo

- [x] Wire up detail view  
- [x] Add data store to persist favoriting an event  
- [ ] Add async loading of remote images  
- [ ] Add test coverage
